## Code Snippet
The following code snippet shows the schema that is the base for our link between our app.js file that operates the functions for building upon our employee tracker, and data base we create with this same schema setup in our sql workbench. Once these two are connected for calling upon our required mysql package and connection port and host thats configured in our JavaScript, We can then execute the functionality of the application through our JavaScript.

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS employee_tracker_db;

CREATE DATABASE employee_tracker_db;

USE employee_tracker_db;

CREATE TABLE department (
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE roles (
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id)
    REFERENCES department(id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    role_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (role_id)
    REFERENCES roles(id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL,
    manager_id INT,
